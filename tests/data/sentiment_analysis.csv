Positive|The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.
Positive|The writers and designers have done an outstanding job with filling the script, the set, and the costumes with all kinds of details true the comic books and the DC world. (The arcane laboratory is fantastic!) There is also a rich dark feel to the whole show that is pure Vertigo. The whole vibe is creepy and wonderful, and fills that blurry good-vs-evil void that Buffy and Angel left behind, without getting maudlin and soap-operatic. The chemistry between John and Zed is snarky and fun, and the supporting cast is so good. Papa Midnite is PERFECT, and Chas is brilliant. One thing that really works is the special effects. They don't get hokey or feel CGI'ed to ridiculousness- A contorting demon, instead of being twisted by camera tricks, is played by an acrobat that leaves you breathless the 15 seconds she is on scene. I so hope NBC doesn't let this one go; it would be as bad a move as Fox dropping Firefly.
Positive|Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.
Negative|The trailer made it seem like a great mystery murder of temptations but it was far far from that with a really dumb twist, acting directing was great but script was bad. I was really exited for this film, it just tanked.
Negative|This movie was an absolute mess. I found myself ancy for it to be over. The first 30 minutes are spent watching Matthew try and catch a fish. I wish I was kidding. The performances felt forced and the acting was terrible. I ignored reviews and decided to give it a chance and I should have listened. Save your money. It's TERRIBLE
